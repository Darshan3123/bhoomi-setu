# Test Buy Flow - Status Check

## ✅ Fixed Issues:
1. **Port Conflict Resolved**: Backend now runs on port 3003
2. **API Connection**: Frontend correctly connects to backend
3. **Property Validation**: Removed landId requirement, now uses property._id
4. **Payment Flow**: Simplified to work without blockchain contract dependency

## 🧪 Test Steps:
1. Open http://localhost:3001/marketplace
2. Click any "Buy Now" button
3. Should redirect to payment page without "Invalid property data" error
4. Payment page should show:
   - Property details
   - Owner information
   - Buyer information
   - Cost breakdown with 2% tax
5. Click "Pay X ETH" button
6. Should simulate payment and show success
7. PDF certificate should download automatically

## 🔧 Current Configuration:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3001
- Backend: http://localhost:3003
- API: http://localhost:3003/api
- Database: MongoDB connected

## 📝 Notes:
- Payment is currently simulated (demo mode)
- PDF certificates are generated with actual property data
- Owner information is fetched from user database
- All validation errors have been resolved
