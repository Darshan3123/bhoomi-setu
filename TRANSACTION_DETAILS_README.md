# Transaction Details Implementation

This implementation adds comprehensive transaction details functionality to the Bhoomi Setu property management system. It fetches and displays detailed Ethereum transaction information using various RPC methods.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Transaction Details Modal Component
- **Location**: `frontend/src/pages/user/properties.js`
- **Functionality**: Displays comprehensive transaction information in a modal dialog

### 2. RPC Methods Used
The implementation uses the following Ethereum RPC methods:
- `eth_getTransactionReceipt` - Get transaction receipt with gas usage and status
- `eth_getTransaction` - Get transaction details including from/to addresses and value
- `eth_getBlockByNumber` - Get block information including timestamp
- `eth_blockNumber` - Get current block number for confirmation calculation
- `eth_getBalance` - Get account balances for from/to addresses
- `eth_gasPrice` - Get current gas price information

### 3. Information Displayed

#### Transaction Status
- Success/Failed status with visual indicators
- Transaction hash
- Block number and confirmations
- Timestamp

#### Transfer Details
- From address with current balance
- To address with current balance (if applicable)
- Transaction value in ETH
- Transaction nonce

#### Owner Information
- **Previous Owner**: Name, email, phone, role, and wallet address with current balance
- **Current Owner**: Name, email, phone, role, and wallet address with current balance  
- **Transfer Value**: ETH amount transferred
- **User Profiles**: Fetched from database using wallet addresses
- **Visual Indicators**: Profile pictures, verification badges, role labels

#### Ownership Transfer Status
- Transfer type (Paid Transfer vs Contract Interaction)
- Confirmation status with visual indicators
- Transfer completion status

#### Block Information
- Block hash
- Transaction index within block

#### Additional Data
- Input data (for contract interactions)
- Event logs (if any)

## Usage

### In Properties Page
1. Properties with transaction hashes will display a "Transaction Details" button
2. Click the button to open the detailed transaction modal
3. The modal fetches real-time data from the blockchain

### Test Page
- Visit `/test-transaction` to test the functionality with sample transaction hashes
- Useful for development and demonstration purposes

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Add to `frontend/.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
```

### Dependencies
The implementation uses:
- `ethers.js` v6.8.0 (already included in package.json)
- React hooks for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Integration Points

### Property Cards
- Transaction hash display with truncated format
- "View Details" button for quick access
- Visual indicators for blockchain-verified properties

### Verification Timeline
- Transaction hashes shown in verification notifications
- Quick view buttons for verification transactions

## Error Handling
- Network connection errors
- Transaction not found scenarios
- Invalid transaction hash handling
- Loading states and retry functionality

## Demo Functionality
- Sample transaction hashes for testing
- Demo button for properties without transaction hashes
- Simulated data for development purposes

## Technical Implementation

### Data Fetching
```javascript
// Fetch comprehensive transaction data
const receipt = await provider.getTransactionReceipt(transactionHash);
const transaction = await provider.getTransaction(transactionHash);
const block = await provider.getBlock(receipt.blockNumber);
const currentBlockNumber = await provider.getBlockNumber();
const gasPrice = await provider.getFeeData();
const fromBalance = await provider.getBalance(transaction.from);
```

### State Management
- Loading states for async operations
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Modal visibility control
- Transaction data caching

## Key Features Added

### Wallet Name Resolution
- **API Integration**: Fetches user profiles from database using wallet addresses
- **User Information**: Displays names, emails, phone numbers, and roles
- **Fallback Handling**: Shows "Unknown User" when wallet not found in database
- **Privacy Conscious**: Only shows publicly available profile information

### Owner Information Display
- **Previous Owner**: Shows user name, contact info, role, and wallet address with balance
- **Current Owner**: Highlights recipient with full profile information and balance
- **Transfer Value**: Displays the ETH amount transferred with ownership indicators
- **Visual Enhancements**: Profile avatars, verification badges, role labels, contact icons

### Ownership Transfer Status
- **Transfer Type Detection**: Automatically identifies paid transfers vs contract interactions
- **Confirmation Status**: Shows confirmation count with visual status indicators
- **Transfer Completion**: Clear indicators for successful ownership transfers

### Removed Gas Information
- Simplified interface by removing technical gas details
- Focus on ownership and transfer information relevant to property management
- Cleaner, more user-friendly display

## API Integration

### Wallet Information Endpoint
```javascript
GET /api/auth/users/by-address/:address
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "user": {
    "id": "user_id",
    "walletAddress": "0x...",
    "role": "user|admin|inspector",
    "profile": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "phone": "+1234567890"
    },
    "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### Error Handling
- **404**: User not found for wallet address
- **500**: Server error during lookup
- **Graceful Fallback**: Shows address only when API fails

## Future Enhancements
1. âœ… ~~Owner name resolution from addresses~~ (Implemented)
2. KYC verification status display
3. Transaction history tracking
4. Transfer notifications
5. Export ownership details to PDF
6. Integration with block explorers
7. Multi-network support
8. Cached user information for performance

## Testing
1. Start local blockchain node on port 8545
2. Visit `/test-transaction` page
3. Click "View Details" on sample transactions
4. Verify all RPC calls are working correctly

The implementation provides a comprehensive view of blockchain transactions, making it easy for users to understand and verify their property-related transactions on the Ethereum network.
