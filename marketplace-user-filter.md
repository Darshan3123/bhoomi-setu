# ðŸš« Marketplace User Property Filter

## âœ… Implementation Complete

### **ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved:**
Users were seeing their own properties in the marketplace, which doesn't make sense since they can't buy their own properties.

### **ðŸ”§ Solution Implemented:**

#### **1. Added User Context**
- Imported `useAuth` and `useWeb3` contexts
- Access to current user and wallet address

#### **2. Enhanced Property Filtering**
- **Primary Filter**: By wallet address (`ownerAddress` vs `account`)
- **Secondary Filter**: By user ID (`owner` vs `user._id`)
- **Debug Logging**: Shows which properties are filtered out

#### **3. Smart Filtering Logic**
```javascript
// Filter out user's own properties
if (user && account) {
  filtered = filtered.filter((p) => {
    // Check wallet address match
    if (p.ownerAddress && account) {
      return p.ownerAddress.toLowerCase() !== account.toLowerCase();
    }
    // Check user ID match
    if (p.owner && user._id) {
      return p.owner !== user._id && p.owner._id !== user._id;
    }
    return true;
  });
}
```

#### **4. Visual Feedback**
- **Property Count**: Automatically updates to show filtered count
- **User Indicator**: Shows "(excluding your properties)" when logged in
- **Console Logs**: Debug information about filtered properties

### **ðŸŽ¨ User Experience:**
- **Before**: Users saw their own properties with disabled "Buy Now" buttons
- **After**: Users only see properties they can actually purchase
- **Cleaner Interface**: No confusing disabled buttons for own properties
- **Better UX**: Focus on available purchase opportunities

### **ðŸ”„ Filter Integration:**
- **Works with existing filters**: Property type, location, price range
- **Respects sold property filter**: Still shows/hides sold properties as configured
- **Maintains sorting**: All sort options still work correctly

### **ðŸ“Š Technical Details:**
- **Dual Filtering**: Checks both wallet address and user ID for reliability
- **Case Insensitive**: Wallet address comparison is case-insensitive
- **Performance**: Minimal impact on filtering performance
- **Debug Ready**: Console logs help troubleshoot filtering issues

### **ðŸŽ¯ Result:**
Users now see a clean marketplace with only properties they can actually purchase, improving the overall user experience and reducing confusion.
